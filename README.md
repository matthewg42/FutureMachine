# Future Machine Arduino Firmware

## Pre-requisites

* Install the Arduino IDE 1.6.6 or later
    * Windows & Mac users may find a download link here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
    * Major Linux distros carry it in their software repositories, or the link above may be used
    * From the library manager, install ''Mutila'' library: https://github.com/matthewg42/Mutila

## Building Using the Arduino IDE

This method is preferred on Windows and for casual users who just want to build and use the project.

* Open Arduino IDE 
* Open `firmware/firmware.ino`
* Set the board to Mega 2560 (under the Tools -> Board menu)
* Connect board with USB cable 
* Click the Upload button on the tool bar

## Using make on Linux

This alternative build system may also be used. It is an alternative to using the Arduino IDE and may be preferred by some users. 

* Install the Arduino-Makefile system: https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile
* Edit the `arduino.mk` file and set the include line to point at where you installed Arduino-Makefile (or set the `ARDUINO_MAKEFILE` environment variable)
* Edit firmware/Makefile and uncomment a `BOARD_TAG` / `BOARD_SUB` for the board you're using
* In a shell, from the `firmware` directory, use the command `make upload` to build and install the code
