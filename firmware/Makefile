# Select your board - uncomment as appropriate. I provided just a few
# common options here.  See the boards.txt file for more.  Some boards
# have just one option, like the uno, for these just provide a BOARD_TAG
# and find it from the first part of the line like this:
# uno.name=Arduino Uno
#BOARD_TAG = uno
#BOARD_TAG = leonardo
#
# Other boards have variants, e.g. the nano has two versions - the older
# one with the 168 or the more modern one with the 328 CPU.  The 168 is
# the default, so we select the alternative CPU like this:
#BOARD_TAG = nano
#BOARD_SUB = atmega328
#
# Pro Mini 5V
#BOARD_TAG = pro
#BOARD_SUB = 16MHzatmega328
#
# Arduino MEGA 2560
